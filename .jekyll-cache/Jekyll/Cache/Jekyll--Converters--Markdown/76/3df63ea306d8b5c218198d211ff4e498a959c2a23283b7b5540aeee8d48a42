<p>Music Educators are encouraging you to learn scales and master them well because learning them establishes the most fundamental insights about music itself.</p>

<h1 id="the-major-scale">The Major Scale:</h1>
<p>Let us look to C major for some observations:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1st  /Root</th>
      <th>Major 2nd</th>
      <th>Major 3rd</th>
      <th>Perfect 4th</th>
      <th>Perfect 5th</th>
      <th>Major 6th</th>
      <th>Major 7th</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that there are no sharps or flats. We can make different scales with root C by following the guides:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For a minor scale, the third and the 7th note must become minor.
Here are C minor scales following this rule:</li>

<h1 id="c-half-diminished-7th-mode">C Half Diminished (7th Mode)</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1st  /Root</th>
      <th>Major 2nd</th>
      <th>Minor 3rd</th>
      <th>Perfect 4th</th>
      <th>Diminished 5th</th>
      <th>Minor 6th</th>
      <th>Minor 7th</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>Db</td>
      <td>Eb</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>Gb</td>
      <td>Ab</td>
      <td>Bb</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The more flats you add to the notes after Root C, the darker the scale sounds.
