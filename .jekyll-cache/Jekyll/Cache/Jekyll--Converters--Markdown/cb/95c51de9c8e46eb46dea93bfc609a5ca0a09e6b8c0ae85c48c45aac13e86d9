<p>Understanding intervals and how to make them is essential for musicians.</p>

<p>what is a major 2nd from C?
the note D, which can also be said to be a Major 9th away from C.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is because there are 7 notes in a scale with the notes after being repeat. the first is also the 8th, the 2nd is also the 9th, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>How about a 4th from E?</p>
<ul>
  <li>the note A, Which is also called the 11th</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing what the interval is between two notes is crucial for learning music by ear.
Music is also TRANSPOSED by re-centering around a different key and preserving the intervals.</p>

<h2 id="scales">Scales:</h2>
<p>You will notice that intervals between notes becomes octaves, therefore repeats, after the so-called 7th. This is because scales in music have 7 notes.</p>

<p>The major scale can be considered the base scale in Western Music. Students are encouraged to learn all 12 possible Major scales, one for each note in the chromatic scale.</p>
