Music Educators are encouraging you to learn scales and master them well because learning them establishes the most fundamental insights about music itself.

# The Major Scale:
Let us look to C major for some observations:

1st  /Root | Major 2nd | Major 3rd  | Perfect 4th | Perfect 5th | Major 6th | Major 7th |
----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -----------
C  | D | E  | F | G | A | B |

Note that there are no sharps or flats. We can make different scales with root C by following the guides:

1. For a minor scale, the third and the 7th note must become minor.
Here are C minor scales following this rule:

# C Minor 7 (2nd Mode)

1st  /Root | Major 2nd | Minor 3rd  | Perfect 4th | Perfect 5th | Major 6th | Minor 7th |
----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -----------
C  | D | Eb  | F | G | A | Bb |

# C Natural Minor (6th Mode)

1st  /Root | Major 2nd | Minor 3rd  | Perfect 4th | Perfect 5th | Minor 6th | Minor 7th |
----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -----------
C  | D | Eb | F | G | Ab | Bb |

# C Half Diminished (7th Mode)

1st  /Root | Major 2nd | Minor 3rd  | Perfect 4th | Diminished 5th | Minor 6th | Minor 7th |
----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -----------
 C  | Db | Eb  | F | Gb | Ab | Bb |

The more flats you add to the notes after Root C, the darker the scale sounds.
