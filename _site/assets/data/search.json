  "content"  : "\n\nTo those people who want to do music I say get familiar with intervals, scales, chords, inversions, and the circle of fifths.\n\nIntervals:\n\n\nUnderstanding intervals and how to make them is essential for musicians.\n\nwhat is a major 2nd from C?\nthe note D, which can also be said to be a Major 9th away from C.\n\n  This is because there are 7 notes in a scale with the notes after being repeat. the first is also the 8th, the 2nd is also the 9th, and so on.\n\n\nHow about a 4th from E?\n\n  the note A, Which is also called the 11th\n\n\nKnowing what the interval is between two notes is crucial for learning music by ear.\nMusic is also TRANSPOSED by re-centering around a different key and preserving the intervals.\n\nClick on the above picture to watch a video on how intervals apply in a Blues Chord Progression.\n\nScales:\nYou will notice that intervals between notes becomes octaves, therefore repeats, after the so-called 7th. This is because scales in music have 7 notes.\n\nThe major scale can be considered the base scale in Western Music. Students are encouraged to learn all 12 possible Major scales, one for each note in the chromatic scale.\n\nClick on this image to learn more about modes and scales:\n\n\nCheck out The Power of Habit Here.\n"
