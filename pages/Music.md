Understanding intervals and how to make them is essential for musicians.  

what is a major 2nd from C?
the note D, which can also be said to be a Major 9th away from C.
 - This is because there are 7 notes in a scale with the notes after being repeat. the first is also the 8th, the 2nd is also the 9th, and so on.

How about a 4th from E?
- the note A, Which is also called the 11th

Knowing what the interval is between two notes is crucial for learning music by ear.
Music is also TRANSPOSED by re-centering around a different key and preserving the intervals.

Scales:
---------
You will notice that intervals between notes becomes octaves, therefore repeats, after the so-called 7th. This is because scales in music have 7 notes.

The major scale can be considered the base scale in Western Music. Students are encouraged to learn all 12 possible Major scales, one for each note in the chromatic scale.
