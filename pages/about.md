Thank you for visiting the Orchid website.
Our mission is to preserve collaborative music making through a webXR experience. Upload your own audio files to the database and let your buddy take a listen to them or pick a starter file from the default rolodex of sounds. See what the waveform looks like of multiple files and synch them up for an easy music making experience.
